PORTFOLIO WEBSITE PROMPT

Build a personal portfolio website for Siddhant Deshwal, Software Engineer (SDE), competitive programmer, and backend systems developer.

Overall Style

– Dark, black-themed interface.
– Subtle, smooth, modern animations.
– Terminal-inspired aesthetic (glowing cursor, command-prompt headers, hacker-style transitions).
– Pixel-art accents sprinkled throughout (small, tasteful elements, not overwhelming).
– Heavy use of technical icons (languages, tools, CP platforms, social links, OS icons, editor icons).
– Layout must feel clean, minimalist, fast, and professional.

Sections & Content
1. Landing / Hero Section

– “Scalable Architecture Enthusiast”
– “Linux Ricer • I Use Arch btw”

2. About Me (Expanded)

Use this content and expand it into polished short paragraphs:

Since childhood, Siddhant has been fascinated by how computers work beneath the surface. That early curiosity matured into a focused engineering mindset—understanding systems deeply, optimizing them, and building tools that genuinely make life easier.
His strength lies in problem-solving, designing scalable backend architectures, and seeing a project through from raw idea to production-ready execution.
He loves working with Linux, customizing entire environments, crafting dotfiles, and tuning his workflow for speed and clarity.
He enjoys blending technical rigor with creativity—coding, competitive programming, and even pixel-art experiments.

Include links/buttons for:
– Dotfiles repo
– Setup overview
– Linux rice gallery
– Short video of his Arch setup (placeholder)
